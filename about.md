Hi There!

Thanks for coming to my site and checking out what I've got going on as far as web design, projects, and hopefully great resources that make us both better at code. I know this is pretty short, but this page is going to have a dynamic interactive resume coming soon (get fucking excited).

Also, lets talk about how blogs are only good really if you're learning something from them. That's what the next couple tabs come in for. I'll drop some hints as I learn them so I can at least give you a good shot at not spending what seems like an eternity on one topic.

That's all for now!
