I started this blog and hosted it with Git-Hub pages so I could showcase what I bring to a Dev shop.
This post also serves as a template for me to create other posts so it won't be going anywhere anytime soon.

Jekyll provides a lot of powerful support for code snippets so be on the lookout throughout the blog to see if you can spot the underlying tech. Here is a ruby example below:

{% highlight ruby %}

def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
